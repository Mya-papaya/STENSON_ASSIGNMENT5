# TouchDesigner Project Reflection

## Overview
For this project, I followed the tutorial titled *"[TouchDesigner Tutorial - Audio Reactive Visuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt2hwb5cngA&t=775s)"* by Acrilycode on YouTube. The tutorial provided step-by-step guidance on creating an audio-reactive visual composition, teaching valuable techniques like linking sound inputs to visual parameters using CHOPs (Channel Operators) and TOPs (Texture Operators).

## Process and Modifications

While adhering to the tutorial’s foundation, I introduced several modifications to make the project uniquely my own. For example:
- I customized the **color palette** and **visual geometry** to align with the mood of the music I selected.
- I integrated **motion patterns** and refined **node parameters** to enhance the fluidity and responsiveness of the visuals.
- I tailored the output resolution and fine-tuned specific settings to create a polished final presentation.

The track I chose, *"Wet Land"* from the album *Wet Land* by Hiroshi Yoshimura, was a key inspiration. Its serene, ambient tones allowed me to design visuals that complemented the tranquil, flowing nature of the music.

## Lessons Learned
This project was an enriching experience, offering both technical and creative growth. I deepened my understanding of TouchDesigner’s capabilities, particularly in manipulating audio inputs to dynamically control visuals. Beyond technical skills, I gained insights into how sound and visual elements can work together to create an immersive, cohesive experience.

Exploring these concepts has inspired me to pursue more projects that blend technology and art, unlocking new creative possibilities.
